# Pandemic-Employee-Tracker

Please view the overview.pptx for more details.

We propose the following COVID-Employee-tracker app for the following use cases:

1.	A manager will be able to track his team members during this pandemic. The manager will be able to graphically view the number of his team members in various zones and the company can take necessary actions to provide help. (Figure 1)

2.	The app can record information about an employee being alone or with family, and will be a platform for a stranded employee to connect with his team to reach out for any kind of help required. 

3.	The app will display the employees living in various zones. This can help higher management in planning phased upliftment of WFH, and determine which employees be called first to the office. For example, for a Bengaluru based company, it makes more sense to call employees in the same city rather than someone living in Delhi. 

4.	Many companies are also following 14-day mandatory WFH-rule even after the employees return to the work city. The managers can view the days left before an employee is ready to join the office. 

5. Integrate with RFID ID Card or punching system Track real time number and percentage of employess inside the campus and in various wings.
